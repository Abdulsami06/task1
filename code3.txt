Reading and Writing to a File

python
Copy code
def read_and_write_file(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
        with open(filename, 'w') as file:
            file.write(content.upper())
        print(f"File '{filename}' processed successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")

def main():
    filename = "sample.txt"
    read_and_write_file(filename)

if _name_ == "_main_":
    main()
Issues and Solutions:

The code reads the content of the file and then immediately overwrites it with the uppercase content. To fix this issue, you should read the content first, close the file, and then open it again for writing. Additionally, it's a good practice to use a with block for both reading and writing.
Here's the corrected code:
python
Copy code
def read_and_write_file(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
        
        with open(filename, 'w') as file:
            file.write(content.upper())
        
        print(f"File '{filename}' processed successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")

def main():
    filename = "sample.txt"
    read_and_write_file(filename)

if _name_ == "_main_":
    main()
